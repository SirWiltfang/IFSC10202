print("Hello World")
#first day o' class

#This is a comment
print("Hello, World")
#You can have a comment after a line of code 
print("Hello, World") #This is a comment
#You can "comment out" a line of code to prevent it from executing 
#print("Good Morning")
print("Hello, World")

# A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it. 
x = 5 
y = "John" 
print(x) 
print(y)
 
# Variables do not need to be declared with any particular type and # can even change type after they have been set.
x = 4       # x is of type integer 
print(x) 
x = "Sally" # x is now of type string 
print(x)
 
# String variables can be declared either by # using single or double quotes:
x = "John" 
print(x) 
# is the same as 
x = 'John' 
print(x)
 
# Python allows you to assign values to multiple variables in one line:
x, y, z = "Orange", "Banana", "Cherry" 
print(x) 
print(y) 
print(z)
 
# And you can assign the same value to multiple variables in one line:
x = y = z = "Orange" 
print(x) 
print(y) 
print(z)
